my game for ld36
playable on [itch](https://xhg.itch.io/ld36)

pause:z // p1:wasd // p2:arrows

[updated sept 6]

this is my go at the ld36 theme of 'ancient tech'. my take on it was the invention of fire/man's first technology kind of thing. concept: pilot crashes in the woods and needs a fire to stay alive until rescue. mischievous gremlin wants to put out the fire. fuel cans add/sub to fire for player 1/2. p1 wins by running out the timer, p2 by the fire going out. song by [mark sparling](https://twitter.com/markymark665)

day 1 was reading godot docs and looking at example projects, day 2 was making the game. pretty basic, but felt like I learned a bit.

issues:
  platforms buggy
  jump physics not tuned
  scoring scheme not balanced
  lag/hitches on web version

unimplemented ideas:
  other maps (shipwrecked, abandoned building, etc.)
  powerups: stun/slow opponent
  online play
